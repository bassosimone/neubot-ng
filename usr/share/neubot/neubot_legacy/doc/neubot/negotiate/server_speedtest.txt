This document briefly explains how the Speedtest test negotiator
interfaces with the generic negotiator code.  For more information
on the generic negotiator code, please refer to the documentation
available at `doc/negotiate/server.txt`.

In ``unchoke()``, Speedtest uses hash(stream) to map a stream to
its unique identifier.  The identifier is installed in a global
table and is returned to the client via the common code layer.

Later, when the client runs the HTTP test, it will send the identifier
in the 'Authorization' header.  Of course, the server checks such
authorization against its global table and closes the connection if
it is unknown.
