This document briefly explains how the BitTorrent test negotiator
interfaces with the generic negotiator code.  For more information
on the generic negotiator code, please refer to the documentation
available at `doc/negotiate/server.txt`.

In ``unchoke()``, BitTorrent uses str(hash(stream)) to map a stream to
its unique identifier.  The SHA1 of the identifier is installed in a
global table and the identifier is returned to the client via the common
code layer.

Later, when the client establishes and negotiates a BitTorrent
connection with the server, it uses SHA1(identifier) to identify
the torrent.  Of course, the server checks the SHA1 against its
global table and closes the connection if the SHA1 is unknown.
