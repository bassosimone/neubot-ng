This file documents the raw transmission test.  This is a test that aims at
characterizing the user Internet connection by estimating round-trip latency
at application level, and by measuring the download goodput.  During the
download, the test captures snapshots of the download goodput on the client,
and snapshots of Web100 variables on the server.

The test is implemented by a number of files having the word `raw` in their
name.  Each of these files is briefly described below.

neubot/database/table_raw.py
  Definition of SQL table for saving results on the client side, plus functions
  to save and retrieve results.

  Note: this file is scheduled to be moved to neubot/raw_table.py.

neubot/negotiate/server_raw.py
  Extends the base negotiate server (neubot/negotiate/server.py) with the bits
  needed to negotiate raw tests.  The code in this file is invoked on the server
  side during the `negotiate` and `collect` phases of the test.

  Note: this file will probably be moved to neubot/raw_negotiate_srvr.py.

neubot/raw.py
  Implements the raw command, i.e. this file contains the main() that is
  invoked when you type `neubot raw` from command line.

neubot/raw_analyze.py
  Helper code to quickly postprocess client-side application-level results, to
  shrink the amount of data saved into the database.

neubot/raw_clnt.py
  Implements the client-side `test` phase of the raw test (code for `negotiate`
  and `collect` phases is not here).

neubot/raw_defs.py
  Definitions shared by raw_clnt.py and raw_srvr.py.

neubot/raw_negotiate.py
  Implements the client-side `negotiate` and `collect` phases of the raw test,
  and invokes raw_clnt.py during the `test` phase.

neubot/raw_srvr.py
  Implements the server-side `test` phase of the raw test (code for `negotiate`
  and `collect` phases is not here).

neubot/raw_srvr_glue.py
  Extends raw_srvr.py code to add access control: clients that have not
  performed negotiation are not allowed to run the test.

regress/neubot/raw_analyze.py
  Regression tests for the raw_analyze.py module.
