The file neubot/web100.py contains a simple, pure-python web100 client
implementation (which is considerably simpler than libweb100, doesn't have the
web100 agent, and is specifically designed to accomplish just the needs of
Neubot).

Specifically, neubot/web100.py allows to take a snapshot of the state of
specific connections tracked by web100.  The connection is looked up by
iterating over /proc/web100/*/spec-file to find a matching spec.  Differently
from libweb100, the search is not interrupted after the first match, since
web100 documentation says that it's possible to have multiple matches.  When
this happens (it should not happen very frequently) the web100.py code does
not return any result.

The snapshot is a dictionary, where standard web100 variables names map to
the respective value.  All types are treated as one would expect, e.g.
INTEGER32 is converted to a python `int` type.  The only exception to this
rule are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, which are not represented in human readable
format, but rather as strings containing an hexadecimal number.  Also the
code ensures that IPv4-mapped and IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses are converted
to IPv4 addresses, for consistency with neubot/utils_net.py code.

Last remark: for now I've decided to return only standard web100 variables,
omitting deprecated and extended variables, i.e. the ones starting with,
respectively, '_' and 'X_'.
